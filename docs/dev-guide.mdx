## Key concepts & terminology

The platform comes with a rich set of features and functionality that allow for a high degree of customization, so we recommend that you familiarize yourself with the different aspects of the platform as listed below.

[Demisto Concepts, and Terminology](https://support.demisto.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005126713-Demisto-Components-Concepts-and-Terminology)

  - [The Demisto CLI](https://support.demisto.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002333194-The-CLI-Command-Line-) - Think of this like an operating system CLI that is built into the product, and connects to every tool that you need. It allows the user to test and run integration commands, run automations, and more. 
  - [Incidents](https://support.demisto.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005126713-Demisto-Components-Concepts-and-Terminology#h_571910869151527515268695) - From third party systems, email, etc., or created manually. Its the combination of a ticket and real time data. 
  - [Integrations](https://support.demisto.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005126713-Demisto-Components-Concepts-and-Terminology#h_401233651221527515275882) - Product integrations (or apps) are mechanisms through which security orchestration platforms communicate with other products. These integrations can be executed through REST APIs, webhooks, and other techniques. An integration can be unidirectional or bidirectional, with the latter allowing both products to execute cross-console actions.
  - [Playbooks](https://support.demisto.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005126713-Demisto-Components-Concepts-and-Terminology#h_17615621281527515282557) -  Playbooks (or runbooks) are task-based graphical workflows that help visualize processes across security products. These playbooks can be fully automated, fully manual, or anywhere in between.
  - [Automations](https://support.demisto.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005126713-Demisto-Components-Concepts-and-Terminology#h_471741284321527515376864) - Single purpose automations that generally manipulate data in the system, or used to wrap multiple integrations, or develop single purpose tools that are not complete products. Maybe you have some library that is not a full product that you want to utilize, automations are a good use for this. 
  - [Playground](https://support.demisto.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005126713-Demisto-Components-Concepts-and-Terminology#h_638814023411527515421050) - The place you go in order to test integration commands, automations, and other tools from the Demisto CLI. 
  - [The Demisto Context](https://support.demisto.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006268708-Demisto-Incident-Context) - All of the above are tied together by way of something called the Demisto Context. Every incident and playbook has a place to store data called the Context. The context stores the results from every integration command and every automation script that is run. It is a JSON storage for each incident. Whether you run an integration command from the CLI or from a playbook task, the output result is stored into the JSON context in the incident or the playground. Simply put, if you have a command like ``` !whois query="cnn.com" ``` it would return the data and store the results into the context.  
  - [Indicators](https://support.demisto.com/hc/en-us/articles/360005126713-Demisto-Components-Concepts-and-Terminology#h_812388463361527515415520) - Indicators are any type of data that you want to match using regular expressions, or add to the system. Indicators can be assigned certain integration commands, and automations in order to determine reputation, take action, enrich, the list goes on here.
